# Project 1 Simulation
 
## Features Implemented

PART 2B:

* Single Agent Navigation
* 3D Rendering & Camera
* Improved Agent & Scene Rendering
* Orientation Smoothing
* Multiple Agents Planning

Challenge: Crowd Simulation (grad*)

## User Controls

* 'r' -- reset to a randomly generate scene
* 'z' -- add an agent to scene. The maximum number of agents is 10
* 'x' -- remove an agent from scene. The minimum number of agents is 0
* 'c' -- click to able or disable the rendering of sphere boundary of each 3D model
* 'v' -- click to able or disable the rendering of path from an agent's current position to its goal
* 'w', 'a', 's', 'd', 'q', 'e' -- navigate the movement of camera
* 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right' -- control the rotation of camera
